=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
Nice work here.  I like that you break things down into segments which make
it easy to see just what the goals and features are.  The tech stack looks
like there are a few 'moving pieces', but I think it's manageable.

Next step here would be to discuss the features you have presented, see if
you can determine which are most important to a 'successful' development,
and prioritize your work for the semester to insure those high-priority
items get built and tested.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Using AI for note-taking is a good idea.  Seems a novel approach to using
AI to learn rather than to cheat.  GOOD ON YA!


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  You're rockin' it so far ~ keep going!
