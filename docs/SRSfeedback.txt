Documentation Feedback ~ Deliverable #2
Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   This is very good.  The explanations of the parts are clear and define
   each part distinctly.  The format of the document is lovely, and I like
   the diagram ~ very explanatory!

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   This is a bit light, and is not in the proper format for either agile or
   waterfall specifications.  If you are using agile, your requirements are
   in the form:

      1. As a CoursePilot user
         I want to select a class
         so that I can name the class.
      2. As a CoursePilot user
         I want to select a class
         so that I can assign an emoji to the class
      3. As a CoursePilot user
         I want to select a class
         so that I can assign a title to the class
      4. As a CoursePilot user
         I want to see a list of all named classes
         so that I can assign a note to the class

   There should also be at least one, if not multiple, acceptance criteria
   specified for each requirement.

   If you are using waterfall, your requirements statements must be of the
   form:

      2.1.1.1 The classlist shall allow the user to select a class.
      2.1.1.2 The classlist shall allow the user to name a class.
      2.1.1.3 The classlist shall allow the user to assign an emoji to a class.
      2.1.1.4 The classlist shall allow the user to assign a title to a class.
      2.1.1.5 The classlist shall display a list of all named classes to the user.

   ....and so on.

your choice, and add the performance and environment requirements sections
by the end of the semester for full credit on this document.
