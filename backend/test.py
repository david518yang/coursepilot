        Philosophy is the systematic study of fundamental questions about existence, 
        knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed 
        as problems to be studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined 
        by Pythagoras (c. 570 â€“ c. 495 BCE); others dispute this. In any case, 
        philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, 
        and systematic presentation.
        
        Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to 
        prove it? What is most real? Do humans have free will? Is there a best way to live? 
        Is it better to be just or unjust?
